# screeps-ai
My screeps AI code. For the moment, it's basic Screeps code put together from tutorial sources and some from th_pion. As I get a handle for what's going on I will implement my own code and annotate such on my pushes.

**To Do**

* Design Code based off Tutorial Goals
* Expand, Refactor, and Modularize Code
* Explore Automation relative to RCL/GCL
